 <h2>The cat</h2>
 <p>Cats have been domesticated for around 4,000 years. While they were once valued for their hunting abilities, they are now valued for their companionship and loving behaviour.
While not well known, the collective nouns used for cats and kittens are a clowder of cats and a kindle of kittens.
Our domestic cats are known as little cats. They differ from large cats such as lions and tigers because they are naturally active at night and can purr.
Cats are now the most popular pet in the UK and in the US.</p>
